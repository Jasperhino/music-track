This project generates musical portraits of the top 100 tracks from each decade between the years 1960 and 2020.
The project's visualization consists of two components. The main component on the right side is a collection of six small multiples
each containing a novel graph type we called the radar box plot, a mixture between a radar chart and a radar box plot.
